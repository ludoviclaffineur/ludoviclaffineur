I am an enthusiastic Belgian who loves to build and create things. I truly believe that being empathic and direct to your peers is a gift and that we should not be too focus to do things only for a bigger purpose -- *Enjoy the ride*.

I studied engineering at I.S.I.B. in Brussels in 2013 and my first work experience was a 2 year R&D project in the field of network sonification [Laras](http://laras.be). The main goal was to create sound from network packets in order to have a direct audio picture of what's happening on the network infrastructure (more to come soon).


In September 2015 I started to work for [Odoo](https://odoo.com) as a client solution developer where I was responsible to develop and ship customisations for the customers. I learnt practices to develop value to custommers and only focuse on what matters for him -- The excellence of services lies in our capacity to deliver quality fast and I truly believe that business analysis and client management are key to achieve that.


In September 2017 I got the opportunity to join at [Skipr](https://skipr.co) (even before it was created) as developer in order to build an app that would enable everyone to move everywhere. That is the first time that I am part of building a product from scratch with all the validation of intermediate steps. We went from 1 to 30 people in two years and are live in Belgium and ready to spread in Europe.


Our tech stack at skipr is based on go (go-micro), python (django), K8s, flutter (!). We are always keen to meet new talented people so don't hesitate to reach me!
