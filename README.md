# 👋 Hey, I'm Ludo!

I'm a passionate Belgian engineer, entrepreneur and product builder who believes in **technology that serves people**.

Currently CTO & CPO at [Govrn](https://govrn.com), I’m building the next-generation **AI-driven board management platform**. I believe that the right mix of **cutting-edge technology**, **user experience**, and **pragmatic execution** can truly transform how decisions are made at the top of organizations.

## 🚀 What drives me

- 🧠 **AI enthusiast**: I'm deeply curious about how artificial intelligence can boost our creativity, speed up execution, and simplify complex workflows. I love embedding smart assistants and automation into code and websites — without ever compromising on **human value**.
  
- 🛠 **Builder mindset**: I’ve co-built products from scratch, from the first commit to scaling a dev team and shipping to thousands of users. Whether it’s backend in Go or Python, UIs in React/Flutter, or infrastructure on K8s — I care about the full picture.
  
- 💡 **Product-first**: I believe that engineering is here to **serve product** — not the other way around. I thrive in environments where we ship fast, validate ideas, and iterate with users.
